You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at index 0.

Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at index i, you can jump to any index (i + j) where:

0 <= j <= nums[i] and
i + j < n
Return the minimum number of jumps to reach index n - 1. The test cases are generated such that you can reach index n - 1.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
It's guaranteed that you can reach nums[n - 1].
